        <p>If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be crunchy, would it? Oh and Jenkins,
          apparently your mother died this morning. Stwike him, Centuwion! Stwike him
          vewy wuffly!</p>

        <p>Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time. I'm Brian, and so's my
          wife! Shut your festering gob, you tit! Your type really makes me puke you
          vacuous, toffy-nosed, malodorous pervert! Hey! Your nose is going to be three
          foot wide across your face by the time I'm finished with you!</p>

        <p>Oh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face? I sometimes hang awake at
          night, dreaming of being spat at in the face Hegel is arguing that the reality
          is merely an a priori adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the
          categorical imperative is holding that ontologically it exists only in the
          imagination, and Marx claims it was offside.</p>
